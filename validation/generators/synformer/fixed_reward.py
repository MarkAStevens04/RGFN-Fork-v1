"""Frozen reward generators for the SynFormer entrant.

Per the repo convention this is a **per-adapter copy** (mirrors ``validation/generators/{rxnflow,
fraggfn,s3gfn,reinvent,saturn}/fixed_reward.py``) so the ``synformer`` env stays self-contained. The
classes are byte-for-byte the REINVENT and Saturn adapters' — verified by AST comparison, because the
benchmark's central fairness claim is that every entrant optimizes the *same* frozen reward, and
identical code is the cheapest way to keep that true. It is also checked numerically: the sEH MPNN
returns 0.0273 for ethanol in the ``synformer``, ``saturn``, ``reinvent4`` and ``s3gfn`` envs alike.

- :class:`SEHFrozenReward` — the Bengio-2021 sEH MPNN.
- :class:`DRD2FrozenReward` — the cached TDC DRD2 activity oracle (``oracle/drd2_current.pkl``),
  loaded from the pickle rather than through ``tdc.Oracle`` on purpose: TDC self-downloads into
  ``./oracle`` on first use, which fails on a compute node. The ``synformer`` env has no ``pytdc``
  at all for that reason.

:meth:`predict` returns the RAW oracle value — the scale the per-target mode gate uses (sEH ``> 7.0``,
DRD2 ``> 0.5``) — and is the only method the GA driver calls. ``reward()`` exists for interface parity
with the GFlowNet entrants and is unused here.

        # blanking the GPU stopped the 6 descriptors, constraining threads stopped the 128-191 pool,
        # and device_count.cache_clear() stopped the stale zero. Job 75080 then tested the premise

        # The parent measured CLEAN on every metric the probe reports and the fork failed anyway, so
        # those metrics are necessary but not sufficient and the guards were treating symptoms. Any
        # in-parent sEH load is incompatible with forking a CUDA child; the fix has to keep this

    tell them apart. Only the process in which the model lives differs.

    WHY. SynFormer forks workers every generation, and job 75080 (entry [074]) established that
    loading the sEH model in the COORDINATING process makes every later spawn fail with
    ``No CUDA GPUs are available``, with the parent measuring clean on both descriptor and thread
    counts. Descriptor/thread hygiene is necessary but not sufficient; the model simply must not be
    in the parent. That left the three sEH cells blocked because no out-of-process entry point for
    the surrogate existed. ``score_seh_subprocess.py`` is that entry point and this is its client.

    UNLIKE :class:`DockingBridgeReward` this does NOT cross an env boundary -- the synformer env can
    import ``bengio2021flow`` (the rgfn env cannot), so the child runs in the same env and only the
    PROCESS differs. Nothing here needs conda.
