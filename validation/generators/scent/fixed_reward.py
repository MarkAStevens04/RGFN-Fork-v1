"""``ScentFixedRewardRun`` — the SCENT counterpart of ``glue/fixed_reward/pipeline.py``.

The fixed-reward (single-shot) analogue of ``ScentActiveLearningLoop``: train SCENT's
cost-guided reaction-GFN **once** against a **fixed reward generator** — SCENT's own
frozen pretrained ``SehMoleculeProxy`` (the same Bengio-2021 sEH checkpoint RGFN uses) —
then sample a batch with synthesis routes and emit a standard candidate dataset. No
active-learning loop, no oracle, no proxy refit. SCENT's entry in the matched four-way
sEH comparison (the cost-aware synthesizable peer).

Because SCENT is an RGFN fork sharing ``rgfn.api`` (same ``Trainer.train()``, forward
sampler, ``ReactionStateTerminal``), this is almost line-for-line RGFN's
``FixedRewardPipeline`` — it just runs in the ``scent`` env (sibling imports; SCENT's
``rgfn`` must not be shadowed) and, since that env can't import ``glue``, emits candidates
by shelling out to ``scripts/ingest_candidates.py`` under the ``rgfn`` env (like the AL
loop shells to the oracle bridge).
