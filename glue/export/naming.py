"""Template string -> named reaction, for the route dataset's schemes and protocols.

WHY A TABLE AND NOT A HEURISTIC ON THE FLY. The reaction templates are the ground truth: the
transformation is whatever the template encodes. A name is a READING AID and nothing else, so it must
never become the identifier -- ``template_id`` is what joins, and a wrong name should be visibly
wrong rather than quietly authoritative. ``docs/ROUTE_DATASET_SCHEMA.md`` §4.3 says the same thing
about ``metadata.named_reaction``.

Two facts make this tractable. The 168 distinct templates across the four published cells are heavily
REDUNDANT -- most transformations appear 2-8 times with the reactant SMARTS in a different order
(136 and 137 are the same acid + primary amine -> amine template, anchored on either reactant) -- and
they are heavily CONCENTRATED: the top 20 account for ~90% of all steps. So classifying by the
transformation's signature, rather than enumerating ids by hand, covers the corpus with a few dozen
rules.

WHY IT MOVED HERE (was ``experiments/lsd_hubs/campaign/reaction_names.py``). The route exporter in
this package needs the same names the campaign analyses use, and ``glue/`` may not import from
``experiments/``. Keeping one table and re-exporting it from the old module is the only arrangement
in which a name cannot mean two different things in two different artifacts. Dependency-free (no
RDKit, no torch) so importing it costs nothing.

``experiments/lsd_hubs/campaign/reaction_names.py`` still owns ``emit_review_table()``, which prints
every id with its count, coverage and assigned name so a chemist can audit the whole mapping in one
pass. Anything the rules do not recognise is named ``?`` rather than guessed -- an unnamed step is
honest; a mislabelled one is not.
