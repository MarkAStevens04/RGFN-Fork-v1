"""``FixedRewardPipeline`` — the RGFN-paper single-shot training mode (no active learning).

Our active-learning pipeline (``glue/active_learning/loop.py``) trains RGFN through
``[bengio2021gflownet]`` Alg. 1: fit a learned proxy ``M`` on oracle labels, train the
GFN against ``r(x) = M(x)^beta``, label a query batch with the expensive oracle ``O``,
refit ``M``, repeat for ``N`` rounds. The **RGFN paper itself** (``[koziarski2024rgfn]``
§4) does none of that: it trains the GFN **once** against a **fixed reward generator**
and reads off the result. This pipeline is that mode — the single-shot counterpart to
``ActiveLearningLoop``, kept deliberately parallel to it so the two are easy to compare.

Terminology (the project's convention — see ``docs/RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md`` glossary):
a fixed-reward run has **no oracle**. There is only a *reward generator* talking directly
to the GFN every training step. Two flavours, both wired identically here:

    - a **surrogate** reward generator — e.g. the pretrained sEH MPNN ``SehMoleculeProxy``
      (a fast model standing in for expensive docking); or
    - a reward generator that is **not** a surrogate — e.g. ``DockingMoleculeProxy``,
      real GPU docking called directly in the loop.

Deliberate divergences from ``ActiveLearningLoop`` (this is where "fixed reward" differs):
    - **no proxy refit, no oracle, no seed ``D_0``, no rounds, no replay reset.**
    - the reward generator is frozen: it is the *same* proxy instance the trainer's
      reward already uses (wire both to ``%train_proxy``), never retrained here.
    - the per-candidate ``score`` we record is the reward generator's **own value**
      (the proxy value), not an independent oracle label — because there is no oracle.

What it reuses verbatim (so the two pipelines can't drift): ``Trainer.train()`` for the
single GFN run, the AL loop's terminal-state sampling logic, ``extract_route`` for
synthesis routes, ``PhaseTimer`` for wall-clock accounting, and the standard
``CandidateDataset`` writer so a fixed-reward run is just another conformant entrant the
benchmark harness can read next to the baselines.
