"""Budget-greedy synthesis-campaign simulator: hub-batching vs best-candidate (Logs/028, Logs/033).

Two **independent, swappable** strategies for building a diverse library of hits (modes) under a
budget, compared on reactions/mode (+ other axes). They are separate classes that return the **same**
:class:`CampaignResult`, so the future AL loop calls either uniformly
(``batch = [p.smiles for p in strategy.run(budget).accepted]``).

- :class:`BestCandidateStrategy` — rank the generator's sampled candidates by reward, greedily keep
  modes. Mirrors RGFN's paper "top-k". Reward evaluations are reused from sampling → 0 new.
- :class:`HubBatchingStrategy` — walk pre-ranked, pre-enumerated hubs; build each scaffold once,
  diversify into modes. Reward evaluations = the enumerated children scored (the second cost axis).

**Cost accounting — ONE count-once model for both strategies (Logs/033).** A library's reaction
cost decomposes into two count-once parts:

  1. **Assembly couplings** — the reaction steps that *join* pre-built fragments. Each molecule's
     shallow assembly depth is ``couplings = num_reactions − Σ(nested build cost of every promoted
     fragment it attaches)`` (SCENT's ``num_reactions`` is FULLY NESTED — it already includes
     building each dynamic-library fragment; see ``reaction_env.py``). A **shared hub** (a scaffold
     several modes descend from) has its couplings charged **once**, then each mode pays only its
     marginal couplings (≈1 for an immediate-parent hub).
  2. **Promoted-fragment builds** — each distinct dynamic-library fragment is built + charged
     **exactly once** across the whole campaign (closure under recipes; reusable stock).

Both strategies amortize both parts identically; the ONLY difference is the SELECTION. Hub-batching
shares hubs **by design** (enumerated children of one scaffold). Best-candidate shares hubs
**accidentally** — when its top-reward picks happen to descend from a common parent hub — via a
swappable :class:`HubAssignmentPolicy` (default :class:`MostSharedAssignment`: assign each mode to
the parent hub most reused among the accepted modes → a greedy upper bound on realistic savings).
Hub sharing here is **immediate-parent only** (``records.csv`` ``hub_key``); deeper-backbone sharing
awaits the sample re-run's per-molecule ``routes.json``.

Both budget dimensions read off the same run: Case 1 ``("reactions", N)`` → stop at N reactions,
report modes; Case 2 ``("modes", N)`` → stop at N modes, report reactions. ``budget=None`` runs the
whole pool (the full modes-vs-reactions curve). NO active-learning loop here — that consumes this.
