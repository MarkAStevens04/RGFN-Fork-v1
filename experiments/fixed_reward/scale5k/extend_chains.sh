# extend_chains.sh — deepen the DOCKING cells' afterany chains to fill spare submit-cap slots.
#
# Complements orchestrate.sh (which LAUNCHES idle cells with short mini-chains). This one takes the
# cells that are already active and, round-robin LONGEST-POLE-FIRST, appends afterany links to their
# chain tails until the live submit budget (CAP - HEADROOM - my current jobs) is spent. It targets
# ONLY the docking cells (6TD3/ClpP), because those are the ones that actually churn through many
# 3-day links (~4-17 days); the surrogate cells (sEH/DRD2) finish inside one link, so a deep chain
# on them would just be no-op links — launch those with orchestrate.sh instead. Links use NICE
# (default 0 = normal priority; set NICE=10000000 to deprioritize) and resume-or-no-op via the submit scripts.
