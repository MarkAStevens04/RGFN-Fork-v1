# Union a docking cell's hub slices into the single enumeration the campaign reads.
#
# submit_docking_cell.sh writes each slice to `enum/slice<i>of<n>/`; the slices hold DISJOINT hubs
# (round-robin), so merging is a union of `enum_children.json`'s hub list, a concatenation of
# `enumerated_records.csv`, and a union of the per-hub timings. Kept separate from the submit script
# so a partial slice set is never silently promoted to "the cell's enumeration".
#
# Refuses to publish unless every hub in the cell's hubs.csv is present exactly once — a missing
# slice would otherwise look like a smaller-but-valid enumeration, and the campaign has no way to
# tell that apart from a genuinely small pool. --force accepts a partial (recorded in meta).

# When one hub appears in several slices, keep the copy with the MOST children -- not the first one

# scent_clpp's 25 capped hubs exist both in the original of8/of12 run (truncated at ENUM_MAX=4000) and
# in the of10 re-run (up to 14,943). Sort order interleaves the groups -- 'slice10of12' sorts before
# 'slice5of10' -- so keep-first silently retained 4,000 children for some hubs and 8,276 for others,
# i.e. a merged enumeration that is partly re-enumerated and partly not, with nothing in the output
# saying which. Preferring the larger set is sound rather than merely convenient: the enumerating DFS
# walks action indices in a fixed order and stops at the cap, so a cap-20000 run's children are a
# strict SUPERSET of the same hub's cap-4000 children. Deeper therefore always wins, and the choice is
