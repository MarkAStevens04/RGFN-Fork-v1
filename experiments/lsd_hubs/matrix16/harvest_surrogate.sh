# Poll SURROGATE cells and run the campaign as soon as each one's enumeration lands.
#
# WHY A SECOND HARVESTER. autoharvest.sh delegates "is this cell complete?" to
# merge_docking_slices.sh, which is correct for docking cells (they arrive as N disjoint slices that
# must be unioned, and refusing a partial set is the whole point). A surrogate cell has no slices:
# submit_cell.sh writes enum/enum_children.json directly. So the docking harvester would call the
# merge, get "no slices under <dir>", and classify a FINISHED cell as "not ready" on every round,
# forever -- quietly, since that is also what an in-flight cell looks like. Rather than teach the
# docking harvester a second notion of readiness and risk the in-flight docking runs, this is a
# separate loop with the only readiness test a surrogate cell needs: the file exists and is non-empty.
