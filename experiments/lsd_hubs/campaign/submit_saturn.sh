# SATURN FIXED-REWARD run — a ROUTE-LESS SMILES baseline, same class as S3-GFN and REINVENT 4.
#
# Trains Saturn's Mamba SMILES model by RL (Augmented Memory) against OUR frozen surrogate, injected
# as a `glue_surrogate` oracle component, then samples a pool from the TRAINED agent and emits a
# standard candidate dataset with has_route=0. Routes are recovered downstream by MultiAiZ -> SPARROW
# via submit_competitor_routes.sh, exactly as for the other route-less entrants.
#
# SIZING. Saturn stops on its ORACLE BUDGET (10,000 calls), not a step count, so wall-clock depends
# on how fast it burns the budget: batch 64 with `allow_oracle_repeats: false` means ~156+ RL steps
# minimum, more as duplicates are rejected. The frozen reward itself is milliseconds. 2 h is a first
# estimate — check the first job's real time and trim, and note this is well inside `-p debug`'s 2 h
# limit if the queue on `compute` is congested.
#
#
# MULTI-CELL CHAINING. `CELLS="seh:42 seh:43 drd2:42"` runs those cells sequentially in ONE job.
# This is queue etiquette, not convenience: the account's QOS caps submitted jobs at 60 and this is a
# SHARED tree with three other agents, so eleven short cells submitted individually would crowd out
# their work for no gain. A cell that fails does not stop the rest; the exit status is non-zero if
# any failed, and each cell prints its own DONE/FAILED line.
# Submit:
#   TARGET=seh SEED=42 sbatch experiments/lsd_hubs/campaign/submit_saturn.sh          # one cell
#   CELLS="seh:43 seh:44 drd2:42 drd2:43 drd2:44" \
#       sbatch experiments/lsd_hubs/campaign/submit_saturn.sh                          # chained
# Smoke first — `-p debug` is 2 h max and starts near-instantly, but its QOS allows
# exactly ONE job at a time across the whole account:
#   TARGET=seh SEED=42 BUDGET=200 N_SAMPLES=50 sbatch -p debug -t 00:30:00 .../submit_saturn.sh
