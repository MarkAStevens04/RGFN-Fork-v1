# STAGE 3 FOR A GENERATOR THAT ALREADY CARRIES ITS OWN ROUTES.
#
# submit_competitor_routes.sh is for ROUTE-LESS entrants: it spends 6-12 h planning routes with
# MultiAiZ because those generators emit SMILES with no recipe. SynFormer does not need that step --
# it builds molecules from catalogue blocks by construction and writes a routes.jsonl whose every
# leaf is already purchasable. sparrow_select_frontier.py has had `--route-source external` for
# exactly this since the SynFormer work landed; what was missing was a launcher, so the header of
# submit_competitor_routes.sh called the path "Phase 2 and deliberately absent". This is that path.
#
# WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE ROUTE-LESS PIPELINE, AND WHY IT IS STILL LIKE-FOR-LIKE:
#   * No discovery step. The routes come free with the molecule, so there is no MultiAiZ cost and no
#     `discovery_timing.json`. When compute is compared across generators this ZERO is the honest
#     number, not a missing value -- planning cost SynFormer nothing because it never plans.
#   * No --snapshot. `native` (RGFN/SCENT) routes are shallow and need recipe expansion; `external`
#     routes are already deep, every leaf a catalogue block. Passing --snapshot here would be wrong.
#   * The pool is built from the BUDGET-FAITHFUL candidates. SynFormer is exempt from Stage 2 -- a GA
#     population cannot be upsampled (`pool = have[:n_samples]` is a slice of accumulated elites, so
#     "more molecules" means more GA generations, which is more TRAINING). Its cells are therefore
#     pool-limited BY CONSTRUCTION and must be reported that way, never as a cost result.
#
# Everything else is deliberately identical to the route-less path -- same gate from targets.py, same
# tau, same two selectors, same output layout -- because a cross-generator table must compare
# generators, not procedures.
#
# Usage -- CELLS is a space-separated list of GENERATOR:TARGET:SEED triples:
#   CELLS="synformer:clpp:42 synformer:clpp:43" \
#       sbatch experiments/lsd_hubs/campaign/submit_native_routes.sh
#
#   POOL=naive|pruned   which pool construction (default naive)
#   RUN_SB=0            greedy only; SB can be added later at no re-planning cost

# A pool-limited cell delivering <25 modes produces NO row on a 25,50,... ladder and vanishes from
# the table entirely. These cells are pool-limited by construction, so the low rungs are the point.
# WIDENED 2026-09-07 to match submit_competitor_routes.sh: the old ladder jumped 25->50, and
