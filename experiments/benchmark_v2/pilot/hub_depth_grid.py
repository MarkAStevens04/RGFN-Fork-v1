"""Do library-less reaction-GFNs hub at exactly (reaction cap - 1)?

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. On one cell (sEH seed 42) the flow field's top-ranked hubs sit at depth
(cap - 1) for the two generators with NO dynamic library, and much shallower for the one that has
one:

    rgfn     cap 4  -> depth 3   one step from terminal
    rxnflow  cap 3  -> depth 2   one step from terminal
    scent    cap 4  -> depth 1   three steps from terminal

If that is structural rather than one cell's accident, it says something sharp: a dynamic library is
what lets a reaction-GFN hub EARLY, which is the only place there is anything to amortise. Without
one, reward mass concentrates one step before the end -- the worst possible place to batch from.

This runs `pick_hubs --pool all` over every cell whose sample survives and prints the top-40 depth
histogram per cell, so the claim is tested on the grid rather than asserted from a single cell.
`pick_hubs` is pure stdlib and takes ~0.2 s, so the whole grid costs seconds.

EACH CELL GETS ITS OWN OUTPUT DIRECTORY. `pick_hubs` writes `hub_scores.csv` and
`pick_hubs_timing.json` to a FIXED name in the parent of `--out`, so two runs sharing a parent
silently clobber each other's provenance -- which is how a stale hub_scores.csv is produced.

FragGFN is reported but is NOT a test of the claim: its moves are fragment attachments, not
reactions, so its "depth" is not a reaction count and it has no reaction cap in the same sense.

Usage:
  python experiments/benchmark_v2/pilot/hub_depth_grid.py --out-root /scratch/.../hub_depth_grid
