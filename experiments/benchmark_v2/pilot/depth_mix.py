"""How much of a hub-batching library sits on DEPTH-0 (bought) hubs?

WHY THIS IS NEEDED. A depth-0 hub is a catalogue building block: a chemist BUYS it, so the cost model
prices it at zero reactions and every one of its children costs exactly one. That is legitimate and
honestly priced -- but it is also the metric's named degenerate optimum, and switching the hub pool
from v1's reward pre-filter to `--pool all` raises depth-0 exposure ~4x in the walked prefix. The
share of a delivered library that rests on bought scaffolds therefore has to be REPORTED, not
assumed harmless. It is unmeasured today and unrecoverable for v1 (the hub-ordering arms kept only
plots, not per-step curves).

THE JOIN. `curve_hub_batching.csv` records `source_hub` per accepted molecule; the enumeration's
`hubs.csv` maps hub SMILES -> depth. Both are keyed on the raw hub SMILES the enumerator was handed,
so the join is exact -- 0 unjoined is asserted rather than hoped for.

Usage:
  python experiments/benchmark_v2/pilot/depth_mix.py \
      --run-dir /scratch/.../depthmix/base --hubs /scratch/.../enum/hubs.csv --budget 100
