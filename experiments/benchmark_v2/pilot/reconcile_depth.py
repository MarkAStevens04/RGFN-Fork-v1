"""Reconcile mode-vs-median hub depth, and report CONCENTRATION beside the central value.

WHY. Two agents read the same cells and published different depths for `scent_clpp` and
`scent_6td3` -- 3 from a mode, 2 from a median. Both were computed correctly; they are different
statistics of a distribution that is not concentrated enough for the difference to be cosmetic.

AND THAT IS THE ACTUAL POINT. "Modal depth 3" reads the same whether the mode holds 75% of the top
40 or 37%, and those are completely different claims about where a flow field puts its hubs. The
(cap - 1) statement is a claim about CONCENTRATION, so the share has to travel with it -- a 37% mode
is a spread distribution being described by its largest bin, not a field that hubs at cap - 1.

Prints mode, mode share, median, and whether the two agree, so a disagreement is visible rather than
resolved by whichever statistic was reached for first.

      --grid experiments/benchmark_v2/pilot/results/hub_depth_grid.json
