"""Verify a benchmark_v2 BACKUP against the copy manifests. Reads only the backup.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `backup_scratch_critical.sh`'s tier-1b assertion compares destination bytes to
source bytes and errors below 95%. That catches a PAYLOAD bug -- which is exactly what bit on
2026-09-08, when an allowlist copied 401 MB of a 57.2 GB tree and exited 0 -- but it cannot catch
CONTENT corruption, in transit or on the destination. Those are different failures and the backup
had a gauge for only one.

WHY IT READS ONLY THE BACKUP, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every copied cell carries
``.copy_manifest.json``, keyed by DESTINATION-relative path, recording each file's size and md5 as
verified at copy time. So this needs no v1 access, no 236 GB ``ledger.tree_digest``, and it works
identically on a restored copy months from now **when the v1 tree may not exist at all**. That last
property is the one that matters: the backup exists precisely for the world in which scratch is gone,
and an integrity check that needs the source is no use in that world.

    ledger.py verify   have the v1 SOURCES moved since we copied them?   (reads v1)
    this               does the BACKUP still hold what we copied?        (reads only the backup)

They do not overlap, and neither substitutes for the other.

⛔ WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU. It verifies the backup against the manifest, so it cannot detect a file
that was already wrong at copy time in a way the manifest recorded too. That is what the copy-time
md5 was for: `copy_forward.py` re-hashed every file after landing it and refused to record a
mismatch. This is the second line, not the first.

COVERAGE IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. A verifier that only compares the files it happens to FIND is the
allowlist bug wearing a different hat -- it would pass cleanly on a backup missing 99% of its
payload, because every file it found would match. So a manifest entry with no corresponding file is
a FAILURE, and files-checked is reported against files-in-manifest every run.

THREE OUTCOMES, KEPT DISTINCT, because collapsing the last two loses the diagnosis:
    match     present, right size, right md5
    MISMATCH  present but the bytes differ            -> corruption
    MISSING   in the manifest, absent from the backup  -> payload loss

⚠ RE-TRAINING A COPIED CELL MAKES THIS COMMAND REPORT "payload loss" ON A HEALTHY CELL, and the
wording will read as corruption when nothing is wrong. ``.copy_manifest.json`` describes the files
that were COPIED FROM v1; regenerate the cell and those files are legitimately gone, so every one of
them comes back MISSING and the run exits 1. Six cells are candidates for exactly that re-train (the
clpp cells short under the oracle-call ruling), so this is a live path rather than a hypothetical.

A regenerated cell is no longer a copy, so it must not keep a copy's manifest: delete
``.copy_manifest.json`` as part of the replacement and re-back-up from the new artifacts. Leave it in
place and the next backup sweep reports payload loss on a cell whose payload is fine -- which is the
same shape as freeze disabling the tooling that operates on the frozen tree, one step later and
invisibly. Its ledger row needs the same treatment: PROVENANCE.csv is append-only and ``verify``
selects ``origin == "copied"`` rows, so a stale copied row keeps re-hashing a v1 source that the
cell no longer contains.

    python experiments/benchmark_v2/tools/verify_backup.py                    # whole tree
    python experiments/benchmark_v2/tools/verify_backup.py --cell saturn/seh/42
    python experiments/benchmark_v2/tools/verify_backup.py --sizes-only       # structure, NOT content

EXIT CODES, AND WHY --sizes-only DOES NOT RETURN 0. The prose output refuses to say "verified" after
a --sizes-only run, but prose is for humans and the exit code is what `&&` chains, watchers and CI
read -- and on this project things do get wired into those. A clean --sizes-only run returning 0
would be indistinguishable from a content-verified pass to every one of those callers, which is the
same "a cheap check that cannot fail the way the expensive one can" failure the --quick warning in
ledger.py is about. So:

    0   content verified: every recorded file present, right size, right md5
    1   FAILURE: at least one file MISSING or MISMATCHed (either mode -- a real failure is real)
    2   structural pass only: sizes and coverage are intact, CONTENT WAS NOT CHECKED

A caller that wants "is this backup good" should test for 0, not for "not 1".
