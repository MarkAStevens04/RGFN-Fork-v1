# Make a verified cell's train/ directory READ-ONLY. The structural fix for the overwrite hazard.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT TIDINESS. Re-invoking any generator runner OVERWRITES that
# cell's trace.csv, candidates.csv, pairs.csv, timing.json and run_config.yaml. That is not
# hypothetical: it destroyed s3gfn_seh/seed43's entire training history, unrecoverably, and
# truncated s3gfn_seh/seed42's budget-faithful candidates.csv from 2,000 rows to 20,000. The
# artifacts a re-run cannot recreate -- a trained checkpoint, the trace that evidences its budget,
# and (for SCENT) recipes observable only while training -- are exactly the ones a stray re-invocation
# lands on.
#
# "Remember not to re-invoke a runner against a copied cell" is a discipline, and disciplines fail
# silently at 3am on cell 71 of 108. `chmod -R a-w` makes it a property of the filesystem: the
# runner gets EACCES and dies instead of quietly rewriting six months of compute. This matters most
# right when the copy-forward step is staging ~40 cells that would otherwise be destroyable.
#
# ⛔ FREEZING BREAKS TOOLS THAT NEED TO WRITE, AND THAT IS A DESIGN PROPERTY OF THIS GUARD, NOT BAD
# LUCK. Three instances in one week, all with the same signature -- the guard works, and disables
# something one step later, invisibly, so the first run looks fine and the SECOND is broken:
#
#   rsync -a implies -p, so the first backup of a frozen cell landed read-only in /project and the
#       NEXT incremental sync could not write into its own destination. Fixed with --chmod=Du+w,Fu+w.
#   verify_cell._write_marker could not write .verified.json into the directory this script had just
#       made read-only, so RE-VERIFYING a frozen cell -- the thing you most want to do to a finished
#       cell -- died with a PermissionError that every caller read as "verification FAILED", when in
#       fact every check had passed.
#   accept_cell.sh had to be ordered backup-before-freeze for the same reason: after the chmod there
#       is nowhere left to record that the backup happened, which is why that record lives in the
#       ledger rather than beside the artifacts.
#
# SO, BEFORE ADDING ANYTHING THAT FREEZE PROTECTS: ask whether a later tool also needs to WRITE it.
# If it does, either move that write ahead of the freeze (accept_cell's ordering) or move the record
# outside the frozen directory (the ledger). A read-only tree is only half a decision; the other half
# is every tool that touches it afterwards.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. Freeze an unverified cell. A read-only wrapper around a broken artifact is
# worse than no wrapper, because it looks finished. Verification runs first, every time, and a
# failure aborts before anything is chmod'ed.
#
# Usage:
#   experiments/benchmark_v2/tools/freeze_cell.sh scent/seh/42 [--arm a]
#   experiments/benchmark_v2/tools/freeze_cell.sh scent/seh/42 --unfreeze     # deliberate re-work
#   experiments/benchmark_v2/tools/freeze_cell.sh --all --arm a               # sweep the grid
#
# Exit 0 = frozen (or already frozen). Non-zero = refused, and the reason is printed.
