# Back up the IRREPLACEABLE parts of $SCRATCH to the def-naeilum PROJECT space, so a scratch purge
# cannot cost us a training run or block post-hoc analysis.
#
# WHY: /scratch on this cluster is purge-eligible and holds everything expensive we produce. The repo
# already versions the small committed results; what is NOT in git and NOT reproducible on a deadline
# is the model weights and the LSD-Flow artifacts derived from them.
#
# WHY NOT $HOME (changed 2026-08-18): /home is a 110 G quota and these backups had grown to 46 G of
# it, pushing it to 89 % and blocking logins. /project has ~1.1 T. The old $HOME copies were migrated
# on 2026-08-18 (copy -> checksum-verify all 227 .pt -> delete). Pointing DEST back at $HOME would
# recreate the outage, which is exactly what this script did before.
#
# /project is mounted on the LOGIN nodes but typically NOT on compute nodes -- run this from a login
# node, as its usage line already assumes. Do not call it from inside a SLURM job.
#
# Two tiers, most-critical first, so a partial run still saves the things that matter:
#
#   TIER 1 (dealbreaker if lost) — trained model weights + what makes them interpretable:
#     last_gfn.pt        the trained checkpoint. Re-training a 5k-iteration cell is GPU-days.
#     guidance_models.pt SCENT's backward-policy sidecar (entry 024). WITHOUT IT the trained P_B is
#                        unrecoverable even if the checkpoint survives -- the guidance MLPs live in a
#                        plain list that state_dict() skips. Losing this silently downgrades every
#                        flow analysis on that cell.
#     candidates.csv     the training run's own candidate pool; the "did this finish?" evidence and
#                        the best-candidate baseline's input.
#     *.gin/*.yaml/meta  the config actually used, so a cell is re-runnable and citable.
#     trace.csv*         ADDED 2026-09-07, and now as irreplaceable as a checkpoint. Two reasons.
#                        (a) Stage 2 (upsample_to_modes.py) harvests the training trace as a FREE
#                        pool of already-scored molecules -- saturn_clpp/s42 reaches its 500-mode
#                        target from history alone, turning 28 GPU-hours into 0. (b) It is the only
#                        evidence of what budget a checkpoint was trained at, which is what the
#                        whole budget-matched v2 campaign rests on.
#                        The GLOB IS LOAD-BEARING: a re-invoked runner truncates trace.csv to its
#                        59-byte header while the real history survives as trace.csv.1, so backing
#                        up `trace.csv` alone would faithfully preserve a stub. Nine v1 cells are
#                        in exactly that state.
#     timing.json        per-phase wall clock; the compute-frontier exhibit's only source.
#     arm_meta.json      which oracle-call count a v2 checkpoint sits at (see benchmark_v2).
#
#   TIER 2 (regenerable, but hours of GPU each) — the LSD-Flow pipeline outputs:
#     sample/  30k-trajectory flow records + compositions + routes (~30 min/cell)
#     enum/    exhaustive one-step enumeration (~20 min to ~9 h/cell)
#     Skips the biggest re-derivable blobs (see EXCLUDES) to stay inside the /home quota.
#
# Deliberately NOT backed up: SLURM .out/.err logs, core dumps, per-run scratch logdirs, conda envs.

# ---- TIER 1b: the benchmark_v2 tree ---------------------------------------------------------------
# v2 lives at $SRC/v2/, NOT under experiments/, so the pass above does not see it at all.
#
# NO ALLOWLIST HERE, AND THAT IS THE FIX, NOT AN OVERSIGHT. This pass originally carried an include
# list modelled on tier 1's. Measured against the real tree it would have copied 401 MB of 54 GB --
# 0.74% -- and reported success: `last_gfn.pt` matches FragGFN's 9 files and nothing else, and
# `checkpoint*.pt` matches NOTHING, because the competitors name their weights
# mamba_<N>_agent.ckpt (131), s3gfn_seh-seed<N>_step<N>_model.pt (81), agent_step<N>.chkpt (81),
# final_mamba_agent.ckpt (18) and agent.chkpt (9). 329 of 338 checkpoints missed.
#
# THAT WAS THE THIRD INSTANCE OF ONE FAILURE: a second (or third) definition of "where this
# generator's weights live", written from OUR generators' conventions, in a place that reports
# success either way. The copy step hit it walking checkpoint DIRECTORIES and missing REINVENT's
# agent.chkpt in the run root. A wrong pattern is indistinguishable from a correct one in rsync's
# output, which is what makes it dangerous.
#
# The right fix is not a longer allowlist. **v2 is ALREADY curated** -- the copy step put exactly
# what the plan named there, file by file, with a .copy_manifest.json recording every one.
# Re-filtering an already-filtered tree through a narrower rule IS the bug. Let the copy manifest be
# the definition of what belongs and take the tree wholesale. Retention is not a space question:
# /project holds 949 G free of 1.2 T against a 54 GB payload, and the milestone checkpoints were
# kept deliberately because they are irreplaceable without a retrain.
#
# THE LOSS WAS NOT ONLY WEIGHTS. The same allowlist dropped TANGO's ARM-2 route pickles --
# 9,696 route_*.pkl under routes/tango_seh_s42/arma/full_pool/ -- which are the 3.5 GPU-h artifact
# carried forward specifically so nobody regenerates it. Checking only the checkpoint half of a
# too-narrow filter is how the other half stays missing.
#
# THE ROUTE PDFs ARE KEPT DELIBERATELY, not by omission. Beside every pickle sits a same-basename
# PDF -- syntheseus's graphviz render, emitted five per target because TANGO's config writer never
# overrides num_top_results. Measured: pkl 9,696 files / 0.067 GiB, pdf 9,696 files / 0.809 GiB, so
# the regenerable decoration is 12x the irreplaceable data and 2x everything the old allowlist kept.
# A denylist for `*.pdf` here would be entirely reasonable and is NOT used, for two reasons: 0.8 GiB
# against 949 G free defends no budget, and adding a second differently-shaped filter to the script
# we are fixing BECAUSE of a filter reintroduces the failure class -- a denylist can be wrong in the
# other direction just as silently. If the PDFs ever matter, drop them here knowingly.
#
# PER-CELL, NOT PER-PHASE. Cells run concurrently and reach each stage at different times, so waiting
# for a phase boundary means waiting a long time and probably forgetting. rsync is incremental, so
# calling this after each cell's stage passes verification is cheap and idempotent.
#
# --chmod KEEPS THE DESTINATION WRITABLE. `-a` implies `-p`, so a frozen (read-only) source cell
# would otherwise land read-only here -- and then the NEXT incremental sync could not write into
# those directories at all. Freeze protects the live tree; the backup must stay re-syncable. (An
# earlier version of this comment claimed rsync does not copy the read-only mode. It does.)

# ADDED 2026-09-12 after finding it had NEVER been backed up. This script's header describes its

# competitor matrix lives in a DIFFERENT tree, `lsdflow_sparrow/`, which no rsync here named. All
# 106 cells of it existed only on purge-eligible scratch.
#
# What is at stake, measured:
#   multiaiz_pools/  958 M — pools AND the cached MultiAiZ routes, at 4.9-10.3 h of GPU discovery
#                    PER CELL (173 route files). Losing this means re-running all of Stage 3 to
#                    recover numbers that already exist.
#   results/         1.4 G — every greedy_frontier.csv (185) and select_frontier.csv (295), the
#                    saturation pre-flights, UNCERTIFIED_R100_BOUNDS.json, and the pre-re-price
#                    greedy tarball. These ARE the published numbers.
#   stage2/          43 M  — upsample_log.json per cell; the source of every oracle-call figure.
#
# NO NAME FILTER, deliberately. 2.4 G against ~895 G free does not justify a clever rule, and a
# clever rule is what made the tier-1 include list silently omit trace.csv, routes.jsonl and
# timing.json — the independent witnesses for those same numbers. A filter that matches nothing
